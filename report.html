                        * Between 1/1/21 and 12/31/21, the average savings off MSRP experienced by consumers who
                        connected with a TrueCar Certified Dealer through the Progressive Car Shopping Service and who
                        were identified as buying a new vehicle from that Certified Dealer was $1,374. Your actual
                        savings may vary based on multiple factors, including the vehicle you select, region, dealer,
                        and applicable vehicle-specific manufacturer incentives, which are subject to change. The MSRP
                        is determined by the manufacturer and may not reflect the price at which vehicles are generally
                        sold in the dealer's trade area, as many vehicles are sold below MSRP. Each dealer sets its own
                        pricing.</p>
